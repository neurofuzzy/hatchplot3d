# **App Name**: HatchPlot3D

## Core Features:

- 3D Scene Display: Display a 3D scene with a box, sphere, and user-controlled camera, with controls to move and rotate the camera.
- Hatching Projection: Enable the user to add, remove, and manipulate directional lights, controlling their position, angle, and intensity. Implement the hatching algorithm to project lines onto the 3D scene from the perspective of each light source, creating shadows.
- SVG Export: Output the rendered scene as an SVG file with vector paths representing the hatch lines. Allow users to download the SVG for plotting on an Axidraw.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark gray (#333) to simulate the black paper.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for controls and interactive elements.
- Split screen layout with 3D scene on one side and controls on the other.
- Use clear, simple icons for light controls and export options.
